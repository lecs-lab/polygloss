# PolyGloss (formerly GlossLM)

A Massively Multilingual Corpus and Pretrained Model for Interlinear Glossed Text

## Overview

PolyGloss consists of a multilingual corpus of IGT and pretrained models for interlinear glossing.

## Background

Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) is a common format in language documentation projects. It looks something like this:

```
o sey x  -tok    r  -ixoqiil
o sea COM-buscar E3S-esposa
“O sea busca esposa.”
```

The three lines are as follows:

- The **transcription** line is a sentence in the target language (possibly segmented into morphemes)
- The **gloss** line gives an linguistic gloss for each morpheme in the transcription
- The **translation** line is a translation into a higher-resource language

Creating consistent and large IGT datasets is time-consuming and error-prone. The goal of **automated interlinear glossing** is to aid in this task by **predicting the gloss line given the transcription and translation line**.

## Using the dataset

```python
import datasets

glosslm_corpus = datasets.load_dataset("lecslab/glosslm-corpus")
```

## Using the model

```python
import transformers

# Your inputs
transcription = "o sey xtok rixoqiil"
translation = "O sea busca esposa."
lang = "Uspanteco"
metalang = "Spanish"
is_segmented = False

prompt = f"""Provide the glosses for the following transcription in {lang}.

Transcription in {lang}: {transcription}
Transcription segmented: {is_segmented}
Translation in {metalang}: {translation}\n
Glosses:
"""

model = transformers.T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("lecslab/glosslm")
tokenizer = transformers.ByT5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google/byt5-base", use_fast=False)

inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = tokenizer.batch_decode(model.generate(**inputs, max_length=1024), skip_special_tokens=True)
print(outputs[0]) # o sea COM-buscar E3S-esposa
```

## Running Experiments

> [!NOTE]
> To reproduce the original GlossLM v1 experiments, please check out the `glosslm-v1` branch.

Interested in replicating or modifying our experiments? Pretraining, finetuning, and inference are handled with `run.py`, as follows:

```bash
# Python >=3.11
# Recommended to use venv for set up
python run.py some_config_file.cfg -o key1=val1 key2=val2
```

The run is defined by an INI-style _config file_. Each experiment should consist of a folder in `experiments` along with configuration files for pretraining, finetuning, or inference. See [an example experiment folder](experiments/base_igt). A config file looks something like:

```ini
[config]

mode = pretrain
pretrained_model = google/byt5-base

# Dataset
dataset_key = lecslab/polygloss-corpus
exclude_st_seg = false
use_translation = true

# Training
max_epochs = 50
learning_rate = 5e-5
batch_size = 16
```

The full list of possible options is in [experiment_config.py](src/training/experiment_config.py). In addition to the config file, you can specify any parameter overrides with `-o key1=val1 key2=val2`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you'd like to run finetuning on a new language, you'll probably need to write your own training script. You can use `run.py` as a reference for how we implemented finetuning.

## Development

### Set up environment
```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements
```

### Testing
Tests should be written as functions in modules prefixed with `test_`, as in `test_evaluate_segmentation_example` in `evaluate.py`. Run tests with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest
```
